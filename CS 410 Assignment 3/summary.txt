Summary List of Refactored Code from the worst smell to the least worst smell.
 
1.
 Line #- 24-33 in the SimpleNotePad.java file, I changed all the fields to private because conforming to good programming practices and to ensure 
encapsulation, the fields of classes have to be private.

2.
In line 117 of the SimpleNotePad.java file, I Removed the unimplemented(todo) functionality of "undo" which had an empty else if statement because this code segment does nothing rathe than
add over head to the program.

3.

I changed the names of the field Variables in SimpleNotePad.java from line 36-59 because fields are supposed to have logical
 and meaningful names
that give an idea of what they accomplish.

4.
I used the Model View Controller pattern to separate different components of the entire application so as to make it easier
to add functionality and maintain and reuse. While the Model stores the data fields, the Controller takes care of the application logic 
while the view displays the application to the client.
